Themes
======

This section aims to documenting the pekwm theme structure providing
enough information to create and modify themes.

Please use the offical pekwm themes as real life examples and base
when it comes to making your own theme. The _pekwm_theme_ utility
supports a new command which creates an empty theme structure.

Theme Index
-----------

Themes can be registered in the
[pekwm theme index](https://github.com/pekwm/pekwm-theme-index)
to make them available for use with the _pekwm_theme_ utility.

See the [pekwm theme index](https://github.com/pekwm/pekwm-theme-index)
for details on how to get your theme included.

Theme Directory
---------------

Themes are contained in a directories with at least a file named _theme_.

The recomended theme structure, as generated by _pekwm_theme new_ is
as follows:

```
my-theme/          <- directory in which pekwm will look for theme images
  backgrounds/     <- directory in which pekwm_bg will look for images
    dark.png
    light.png
  button-close.png
  theme            <- standard theme variant
  theme-dark       <- dark theme variant
  template         <- template file included by both theme variants
```

Attributes

Here is the explanation of Attributes names of themes

### Decor names

Any name can be used and applied to windows with autoproperties or the
set decor action. The list below includes names with special meaning:

* _DEFAULT_, Defines decorations to all windows unless overridden with another decoration set (REQUIRED).
* _ATTENTION_, Defines the decoration for windows that set the urgency/demand-attention hint.
* _BORDERLESS_, Defines decorations for borderless windows (recommended).
* _INPUTDIALOG_, Defines decorations for input dialogs, such as the CmdDialog.
* _MENU_, Defines decorations for menus.
* _STATUSWINDOW_, Defines decorations for the command dialog.
* _TITLEBARLESS_, Defines decorations for titlebarless windows (recommended, should be there if your theme looks nasty when toggled titlebarless).
* _WORKSPACEINDICATOR_, Defines decorations for the workspace indicator.

### Image options

* _#fixed_, Image is fixed size.
* _#scaled_, Image will be scaled to fit the area it's defined for.
* _#tiled_, Image will be repeated as many times as needed to fill the area it's defined for. This is the default if no option is specified.
    
### Textures

* _EMPTY_, No texture (transparent).
* _SOLID colour size_, A solid colour texture of defined colour and size.
* _SOLIDRAISED colour colour colour pixels pixels toggle toggle toggle toggle size_, A solid colour texture with a 3D look of defined colours, form and size. First colour defines the main fill colour, second the highlight colour used on the left and top parts of the texture, third the highlight colour on the bottom and right parts of the texture. First pixel amount defines how fart apart the 3D effects are from each other, second pixel amount is how thick the bordering will be (both pixels default to 1). The four toggles are used to tell which raised corners are to be drawn. This is useful for example when defining solidraised frame corner pieces. The order is Top, Bottom, Left, Right (not unlike that used in padding). As example: "True False True False" (or 1 0 1 0) could mean you want to draw the TopLeft piece of a solidraised window border. Size should explain itself, see above.
* _LINESHORZ size color1 [color2...]_, Fill the area with horizontal "lines" of size. Size can be specified in pixels or percent of the area being filled with the texture.
* _LINESVERT_size color1 [color2...]_, Fill the area with vertical "lines" of size. Size can be specified in pixels or percent of the area being filled with the texture.
* _IMAGE imagename_, An image texture using the defined imagename
