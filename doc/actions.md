Keys and Mouse
--------------

Here is the list of all possible actions and attributes. First table
shows all toggleable attributes. Toggleable attributes are controlled
using the _Set_, _Unset_ and _Toggle_ actions. Examples below.

```
 Keypress = "Mod4 s"       { Actions = "Toggle Shaded" }
 Keypress = "Mod4 m"       { Actions = "Toggle Maximized True True" }
 Keypress = "Mod4 t"       { Actions = "Set Tagged" }
 Keypress = "Mod4 Shift t" { Actions = "Unset Tagged" }
```

### Toggleable attributes

**Maximized (bool bool)**

If a frame is maximized. Two parameters, first one decides if the
frame is maximized horizontally, the second if it is maximized
vertically.

**Fullscreen**

If a frame should be fullscreen. Fullscreen frame takes over the whole
desktop ignoring any harbour or struts and becomes decorless.

**Shaded**

If a frame should be shaded (so that only the titlebar shows until
it's unset or toggled off).

**Sticky**

If a frame should be sticky so it appears on every workspace.

**AlwaysOnTop**

If frame should always be on top of other frames.

**AlwaysBelow**

If a frame should always be below other frames.

**Decor**

When used with Set/Toggle it takes an additional parameter for the
decorname that is set/toggled. Unset just removes the last
"override"-decor.

**DecorBorder**

If frame should have borders.

**DecorTitlebar**

If frame should have a titlebar.

**Iconified**

If a frame should be iconified.

**Opaque**

If the frame should be fully opaque (ie: disable the opacity setting).

**Tagged (bool)**

If a frame should swallow all new clients until unset or toggled
off. One parameter, if true new clients open in the
background. Defaults to false.

**Marked**

If a frame is marked for later attaching (with AttachMarked).

**Skip (string)**

If a frame should be ignored on specified places, string is one of

* menus
* focustoggle
* snap
    
**CfgDeny (string)**

When things to be done to this window requested by the client program
should be denied, string is one of:

* _Above_, ignore client request to always place window above other windows)
* _ActiveWindow_, ignore client requests for showing and giving input focus)
* _Below_, ignore client request to always place window below other windows)
* _Fullscreen_, ignore client request to set window to fullscreen mode)
* _Hidden_, ignore client request to show/hide window)
* _MaximizedHorz_, ignore client request to maximize window horizontally)
* _MaximizedVert_, ignore client request to maximize window vertically)
* _Position_, ignore client requested changes to window position)
* _ResizeInc_, ignore resize increments from the size hints. Use on terminals to make them fill up all available space.
* _Size_, ignore client requested changes to window size)
* _Stacking_, ignore client requested changes to window stacking)
* _Strut_, ignore client request for reserving space in the screen corners, typically done by panels and the like)
    
**Title (string)**

Changes the clients titlebar text to string when set. Unsetting
returns the clients title text back to the client specified one.

**HarbourHidden**

If set, harbour and anything in it will be hidden from the screen.

**GlobalGrouping**

If all autogrouping should be in use or not. By default it's set, as
in autogrouping is enabled.

### Actions

**Focus**

Gives focus to a frame.

**UnFocus**

Removes focus from a frame.

**Set (one of toggleable attributes)**

Makes toggleable attributes set.

**UnSet (one of toggleable attributes)**

Unsets toggleable attributes.

**Toggle (one of toggleable attributes)**

Toggles toggleable attributes.

**MaxFill (bool bool)**

Acts much like Maximize, but considers other frames while doing
it. Instead of filling the whole screen, it only fills to the borders
of neighboring frames. Takes two parameters, first one decides if the
frame is maxfilled horizontally, the second if it should be maxfilled
vertically.

**GrowDirection (string)**

Grows the frame in one of the directions up to the edge of the
head. String is one of:

* _up_
* _down_
* _left_
* _right_

**Close**

Closes a client window.

**CloseFrame**

Closes a frame and all client windows in it.

**Kill**

Kills a client window, use if close doesn't work.

**SetGeometry (string (int|string) [honourstrut])**

Sets the geometry of a frame. The first option is an extended version
of a geometry string that XParseGeometry can parse. That is

    [=][<width>{xX}<height>][{+-}<xoffset>{+-}<yoffset>]

Both the size and position could be followed by '%' to denote percent
instead of pixels.

The second option specifies the head number that geometry should be
relative to. It could also be a string, either (whole) "Screen" or
"Current" (head). It defaults to -1 which means the geometry is
relative to the whole screen.

If HonourStrut is specified as the third option, the screen or head
geometry will have space for panels (`_NET_WM_STRUT`) removed from the
available space.

**Raise (bool)**

Raises a frame above other frames. If bool is true raises a frame and
all of the currently active clients child/parent windows above other
frames.

**Lower (bool)**

Lowers a frame under other frames. If bool is true lowers a frame and
all of the currently active clients child/parent windows under other
frames.

**ActivateOrRaise**

If the frame this action is used on is not focused, focuses it. If the
frame is focused, raises it. If used on a groups titlebar, activates
the selected client of the group.

**ActivateClientRel (int)**

Moves the focus and raises a client inside a frame relative to the
currently selected client. Int is 1 to move right, -1 to move left.

**MoveClientRel (int)**

Moves the current clients position inside the current frame. Int is 1
to move right, -1 to move left.
