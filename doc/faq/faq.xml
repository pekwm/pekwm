      If you can't find the answer to your question here, read the
      whole thing again. Changes are you just missed it the first time
      around. If you still can't find it, and you have gone thru the
      documentation, tried until your fingers bleed from typing, and
      started a hunger strike against evil documentation projects that
      contain no helpful advices for you, then you may ask your
      question in IRC or one of the mailing lists.
