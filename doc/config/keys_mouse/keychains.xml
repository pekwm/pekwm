<para>
	Pekwm also supports keychains. Keychain syntax follows the general
	config syntax and looks like this:
</para>
<screen>
Chain = "modifiers and key" {
	Chain = "modifiers and key" {
		KeyPress = "modifiers and key" { Actions = "actions and their parameters" }
	}
	Keypress = "modifiers and key" { Actions = "actions and their parameters" }
}
</screen>
<para>
	It might seem complicated at start but once you look into it, it is
	fairly nice and logical. This syntax supports as many nested Chains
	as you might want.
</para>

<para>
	Now for some examples. Here we have a simple nested chain
	that lets you press Ctrl+Alt+M, then M, then M, V or H to
	toggle maximized attribute into Full/Vertical or Horizontal,
	and a simpler one level chain that brings up the root menu.
</para>
<screen>
Chain = "Ctrl Mod1 A" {
	Chain = "M" {
		KeyPress = "M" { Actions = "Toggle Maximized True True" }
		KeyPress = "V" { Actions = "Toggle Maximized False True" }
		KeyPress = "H" { Actions = "Toggle Maximized True False" }
	}
}
Chain = "Ctrl Mod1 M" {
	KeyPress = "R" { Actions = "ShowMenu Root" }
}
</screen>
<para>
	This next rule is a pure show-off, it lets you type in 'test' and
	then executes xterm. Note that this will make you unable to type
	the character 't' to any programs.
</para>
<screen>
Chain = "t" { Chain = "e" { Chain = "s" {
	Keypress = "t" { Actions = "Exec xterm" }
} } }
</screen>
