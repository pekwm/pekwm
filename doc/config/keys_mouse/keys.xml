  <title>Key Bindings</title>

  <para>
    The pekwm keybindings go in <filename>~/.pekwm/keys</filename>,
    and are even more simple than the mouse bindings. Here's the
    format:
  </para>

  <screen>KeyPress = "optional modifiers like mod1, ctrl, etc and the key" {
	Actions = "action and the parameters for the action, if they are needed"
}</screen>

  <para>
    Multiple actions can be given for one keypress. The actions are
    separated from each other with a semicolon:
  </para>

  <screen>Keypress = "Ctrl t" { Actions = "Exec xterm; Set Maximized True True; Close" }</screen>

  <para>
    Here's a small fragment of an example keys file; you can see a
    full version in <filename>~/.pekwm/keys</filename>. As with the
    mouse, you can see the full list of actions in the
    <xref linkend="config-keys_mouse-actions"/> section.
  </para>

  <screen>Global {
	# Moving in frames
	KeyPress = "Mod1 Tab" { Actions = "NextFrame EndRaise" }
	KeyPress = "Mod1 Shift Tab" { Actions = "PrevFrame EndRaise" }
	KeyPress = "Mod1 Ctrl Tab" { Actions = "NextFrameMRU EndRaise" }
	KeyPress = "Mod1 Ctrl Shift Tab" { Actions = "PrevFrameMRU EndRaise" }
	# Simple window management
	KeyPress = "Mod4 M" { Actions = "Toggle Maximized True True" }
	KeyPress = "Mod4 G" { Actions = "Maxfill True True" }
	KeyPress = "Mod4 F" { Actions = "Toggle FullScreen" }
	KeyPress = "Mod4 Return" { Actions = "MoveResize" }
	# Wm actions
	Chain = "Ctrl Mod1 P" {
		KeyPress = "Delete" { Actions = "Reload" }
		KeyPress = "Next" { Actions = "Restart" }
		KeyPress = "End" { Actions = "Exit" }
		KeyPress = "Prev" { Actions = "RestartOther twm" }
	}
}

MoveResize {
	KeyPress = "Left" { Actions = "MoveHorizontal -10" }
	KeyPress = "Right" { Actions = "MoveHorizontal 10" }
	KeyPress = "Up" { Actions = "MoveVertical -10" }
	KeyPress = "Down" { Actions = "MoveVertical 10" }
	Keypress = "Mod4 Left" { Actions = "ResizeHorizontal -10" }
	Keypress = "Mod4 Right" { Actions = "ResizeHorizontal 10" }
	Keypress = "Mod4 Up" { Actions = "ResizeVertical -10" }

	Keypress = "s" { Actions = "MoveSnap" }
	Keypress = "Escape" { Actions = "Cancel" }
	Keypress = "Return" { Actions = "End" }
}

Menu {
	KeyPress = "Down" { Actions = "NextItem" }
	KeyPress = "Up" { Actions = "PrevItem" }
	KeyPress = "Left" { Actions = "LeaveSubmenu" }
	KeyPress = "Right" { Actions = "EnterSubmenu" }
	KeyPress = "Return" { Actions = "Select" }
	KeyPress = "Escape" { Actions = "Close" }
}

InputDialog {
	KeyPress = "BackSpace" { Actions = "Erase" }
	KeyPress = "Right" { Actions = "CursNext" }
	KeyPress = "Left" { Actions = "CursPrev" }
	KeyPress = "Up" { Actions = "HistPrev" }

  <para>
    As you might have noticed, the file consist of four sections.
    These sections are Global, MoveResize, Menu and InputDialog.  The
    first section, Global, contains all the generic actions.
  </para>

  <para>
    The MoveResize section has the keybindings that will get used when
    the MoveResize action is called.
  </para>

  <para>
    Menu section contains the keys that are used when the ShowMenu
    action is called. E.g. these are the keys you use to browse thru
    the menus of pekwm. Note that while ShowMenu is active, the Global
    keybindings are also listened. If a keybinding is same in both
    Menu and Global sections, keybindings in Menu section override the
    global keybinding as long as a menu is active.
  </para>

  <para>
    Finally, the InputDialog section allow for tuning of what keys are
    available for line editing when the CmdDialog window that enables
    the user to enter pekwm actions for running windows is active.
  </para>

  <para>
    Keys can be identified with their XString name or with their
    keycode.  Both can be found out using the X
    application <command>xev</command>.  If you want to use a keycode,
    prefix it with <command>#</command>.
  </para>
