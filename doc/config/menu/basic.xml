  <para>
    As previously indicated, the root and window menus follow the rules defined in 
    <xref linkend="config-syntax"/>. There aren't many possible options,
    and they're all either within the main menu, or within a submenu. This 
    is all handled by a single file.
  </para>
  <para>
    As addition to the default menu types, RootMenu and WindowMenu,
    user can define any number of new menus following the same syntax.

  <para>
    Here's an example <filename>~/.pekwm/menu</filename> file, where
    we have the usual RootMenu and WindowMenu and our own most used
    applications menu called MyOwnMenuName:

  <screen># Menu config for pekwm
