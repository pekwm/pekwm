<para>
It is possible to use dynamic menus in pekwm, that is menus that regenerate
themself whenever the menu is viewed. This is done with the Dynamic keyword.
</para>

<para>
To use this feature, you need to put a dynamic entry in the
<filename>~/.pekwm/menu</filename> file with a parameter that tells pekwm
what file to execute to get the menu. This file can be of any language you
prefer, the main thing is that it outputs valid pekwm menu syntax inside
a Dynamic {} section. The syntax of dynamic entry looks like this:
</para>

<screen>Entry = "" { Actions = "Dynamic /path/to/filename" }</screen>

<para>
The input from a program that creates the dynamic content should follow
the general menu syntax encapsulated inside a Dynamic {} section.
Variables have to be included inside the dynamic menu for them to work.
A simple script to give pekwm dynamic menu content would look like this:
</para>

<screen>#!/bin/bash
output=$RANDOM # gets a random number

echo "Dynamic {"
echo " Entry = \"$output\" { Actions = \"Exec xmessage $output\" }"
echo "}"
</screen>

<para>This script would output something like:</para>
<screen>Dynamic {
 Entry = "31549" { Actions = "Exec xmessage 31549" }
}
</screen>
