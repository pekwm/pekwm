  <title>Guidelines</title>

  <para>
    It is strongly recommended and expected that theme tarballs are
    labeled for the pekwm version they are made and tested with. The
    filename format should be
    <filename>theme_name-pekwm_version.[tar.gz|tgz|tar.bz2|tbz]</filename>.
    For example <filename>silly_theme-pekwm_0.1.5.bz2</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
    It is also highly recommended that theme directories are named in
    a similar fashion. However, for stable releases this is not
    mandatory, the tarball filename is enough. If you're building for
    a GIT revision, mention it in as many places as possible.
  </para>

  <para>
    The silly theme from above would contain a directory structure as follows:
  </para>

  <screen>silly_theme-pekwm_0.1.5/
pekwm_0.1.5/theme
pekwm_0.1.5/menubg.png
pekwm_0.1.5/submenu.png</screen>

  <para>
    The theme file header should contain at least the themes name, the
    pekwm version the theme is for, address to reach the theme
    maker/porter or get an updated theme, and a last modified
    date. Changelog entries won't hurt if you aren't the original
    theme author. For example:
  </para>

  <screen># silly, a PekWM 0.1.5 theme by shared (themes@adresh.com)
# This theme is available from hewphoria.com.
# Last modified 20060529.

# Extract this theme directory under ~/.pekwm/themes/ and the
# themes menu will pick it up automatically.

# Changelog:
# 2006-05-29 HAX0ROFUNIVERSE &lt;hawt@haxorland.invalid&gt;
#  * REWROTE EVERYTHING WITH CAPS LOCK ON,
#    CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL!</screen>

  <para>
    Try to stick to the theme syntax and rather than deleting entries please use the EMPTY texture.
