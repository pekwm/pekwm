  <title>Screen Subsections</title>

  <para>
    There are two subsections in the screen section - Placement and UniqueNames.
    Placement can optionally have it's own subsection. Sound hard? It's not! It's 
    really quite simple.
  </para>
  <para>
    We'll start off with Placement. Placement has two options: Model, and a 'Smart'
    subsection. Model is very simple, it's simply a list of keywords that describes 
    how to place new windows, such as "Smart MouseCentered".
    Secondly, there's a Smart section, which describes how pekwm computes where 
    to place a new window in smart mode.
  </para>
  <para>
    The second subsection, UniqueNames, lets you configure how pekwm should
    handle similar client names.  Pekwm can add unique number identifiers to
    clients that have the same title so that instead of "terminal" and
    "terminal", you would end up with something like "terminal" and
    "terminal [2]".
  </para>
